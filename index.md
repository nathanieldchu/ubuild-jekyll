  headline: building a more <strong>sustainable</strong> world
  content: Inspired by the natural world and driven to preserve it, we set out to
    change the food system for the better. We're a public benefit company, meaning
    that we baked our mission into our corporate DNA. We're not making an industrial
    money machine. We're making kick-@$$ cheese and working for shared prosperity
    for our human and ecological communities. <strong>Doing the right thing shouldn't
    have to taste like broccoli</strong> (but for the record, we really like broccoli).
