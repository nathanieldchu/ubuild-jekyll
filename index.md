  content: Inspired by the natural world and driven to protect it, we set out to change

    tiny footprints</strong>. We're a public benefit company, which means we baked
    this mission into our company DNA (we're also nerds, which is why say things like
    DNA).<br><br><strong>Doing the right thing shouldn't have to taste like broccoli</strong>
    (but, for the record, we really like broccoli).
