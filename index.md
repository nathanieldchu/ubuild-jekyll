  headline: building a more <strong>sustainable</strong> world
  content: Inspired by the natural world and driven to protect it, we set out to change
    food for the better. We work to provide foods with <strong>big flavors and tiny
    footprints</strong>. We're a public benefit company, meaning that we baked this
    mission into our company DNA (we're also nerds, which is why we use words like
    DNA).<br><br><strong>Doing the right thing shouldn't have to taste like broccoli</strong>
    (but for the record, we really like broccoli).
