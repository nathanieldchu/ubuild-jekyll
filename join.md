    content: So your mission and vision aligns with ours. The overlap in our core
      values and the characteristics you strive for is uncanny. This is going great!
      We’ve passed the one-drink sniff test and you’ve decided not to pretend that
      you got a text from your friend so you could ditch us. It’s time to ask more
      awkward questions.

    content: 'What sounds like more fun to you:<br><br><strong>Being the expert</strong>
      in something and a company’s go-to resource for that thing. You crush it all
      day long.<br><strong>Continually dreaming</strong> up new ideas, getting totally
      lost, reading 100 wikipedia articles that you never would have guessed existed,
      figuring out how to turn your idea into reality, building a first version from
      scratch and duck tape, building another that you are so proud of, and then repeating
      all of that.<br><br>If the second one sounds like your jam, then we might be
      a good fit. We put equal value on expertise and open-minded ignorance. We love
      learning new topics, building new systems, and making real stuff. Few things
      are as exciting to us as doing something scary and new. Speaking of scary:'

    headline: Do you love type II fun?
    content: ''
  col_2:
    content: In mountaineering, there are three types of fun:<br><br><strong>Type
      I Fun</strong>—also known as “fun” by normal people—is activities that are fun
      in the moment. Eating at your favorite restaurant. Seeing a surprise hit movie
      with your friends. Reading Harry Potter. Outdoor activities with great conditions
      (no bugs, deep powder) and mild objectives (alpine lake swimming, climbing hand
      cracks, fishing).<br><strong>Type II Fun</strong> sucks in the moment, or it’s
      at least hard. It is painful, you are hungry and tired, and you were not prepared.
      You actually might die. Shit, are we going to die? But somehow you make it out,
      and in the rosy glow of hindsight you declare, “Wow what a great experience!
      I learned so much about myself and the world! We did it!” Overzealous alpine
      objectives, your first break-up, having children. In its highest form, type
      II fun is when you feel in your heart like everything is going to shit (imposter
      syndrome, breaking norms, pushing yourself to the limit), but you know in your
      head you are safe.<br><strong>Type III Fun</strong> is not fun ever. It’s awful
      during the process and never redeeming afterwards. Going to the DMV. Running
      through the twinge in your knee only to be in crutches for the next 6 months.
      Irreversible emotional damage from trauma. Avoid.<br><br>Type I fun is great
      sometimes. But to find a home at Tezza, you need to love type II fun. You want
      to push yourself or at least you want to want to push yourself. You may even
      enjoy some of the feelings (fear, intimidation) that you associate with these
      goals. To you, nothing is more satisfying than coming out the other side, saying
      “Wow, we survived! I can’t believe it! What’s next?”

    headline: Are you a little weird?
    content: ''
  col_2:
    content: 'Normal people don’t like type II fun, and if you are a distinctly normal
      person, you probably aren’t going to like it here. We push boundaries: political,
      social, scientific, culinary, etc. Our moral compasses can create odd, occasionally
      fanatic behavior. We might have a draw full of used plastic bags. We might bike
      to work even though it’s 90F or raining. We’ve considered taking a train for
      an outrageously inconvenient distance. We relish breaking traditions or social
      norms in order to do the right thing or to do something well.<br><br>Our weirdness
      also comes across as a bit campy, less Rocky Horror Picture Show, more summer,
      band, or jewish. We aren’t afraid to look like idiots, since we usually act
      like idiots cause life is more fun that way. We are willing to ask awkward questions,
      share too much information, and build relationships quickly. We would rather
      play tag in the mud than wear suits in a conference room. We believe that a
      group of people with a goal and a safe space can change everyone’s life and
      the world and can say that without rolling our eyes (that much).'

    headline: Do you scorn money and power?
    content: ''
  col_2:
    content: If you want money, work in finance. If you want power, management consulting
      is a no-brainer. If you want to join a Silicon Valley startup with glossy offices,
      trendy swag, and fancy cars parked outside, there are many great options.<br><br>If
      you are here, be here because of the mission. Be here to work with other nerds
      excited about the same problems as you. Be here because you feel confident that
      everyone bottom to top wants to use dollars and power to fulfill the mission,
      not the pockets of nameless rich people. We want to value people not because
      of their fancy degrees, but because of what they bring to the company in heart
      and mind. Unless things go to crap, everyone here will make plenty of money
      to be secure, and we don’t abstain from things that bring us joy (see Savor
      Every Bite). But if you wear alligator leather shoes, this is probably a bad
      fit.

      know you more. Please, send us an email at tezzafoods@gmail.com. If we don’t
      have a job for you now, then we’ll make sure that we come running as soon as
      that changes.
