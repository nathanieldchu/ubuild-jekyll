    content: So your mission and vision align with ours. The overlap in our <a href="https://www.tezzafoods.com/values"
      title="">core values</a> and yours is uncanny. This is going great! We’ve passed
      the one-drink sniff test and you’ve decided not to pretend that you got a text
      from your friend so you could ditch us. It’s time to ask more-awkward questions.

    content: 'What sounds like more fun:<br><br><strong>Being the expert</strong>
      in something and a company’s go-to resource for that thing. You crush it all
      day long.<br><strong>Constantly building</strong> by dreaming up new ideas,
      getting totally lost, reading 100 Wikipedia articles that you never would have
      guessed existed, figuring out how to turn your idea into reality, making a first
      version from scratch and duct tape, building another that totally kicks ass
      and shoving it out into the world, and then repeating all of it.<br><br>If the
      second one sounds like your jam, then we might be a good fit. We put equal value
      on expertise and open-minded ignorance. We love learning new topics, building
      new systems, and making real stuff. We may reach a time when we need experts
      to focus on one thing. But right now we seek stubborn optimists who won’t stop
      until the dream in their head lands in their hands. Few things are as exciting
      to us as doing something scary and new. Speaking of scary:'

    headline: Do you love type II fun?
    content: ''
  col_2:
    content: In mountaineering, there are three types of fun:<br><br><strong>Type
      I Fun</strong>—also known as “fun” by normal people—is activities that are fun
      in the moment. Eating at your favorite restaurant. Seeing a surprise hit movie
      with your friends. Reading <em>Harry Potter</em>. Outdoor activities with great
      conditions (no bugs, deep powder) and mild objectives (alpine lake swimming,
      climbing hand cracks, fishing).<br><strong>Type II Fun</strong> sucks in the
      moment, or it’s at least hard. It is painful, you are hungry and tired, and
      you were not prepared. You might die. Shit, are we going to die? But somehow
      you make it out, and in the rosy glow of hindsight you declare, “Wow, what a
      great experience! I learned so much about myself and the world! We did it!”
      Overzealous alpine objectives, your first breakup, having children. In its highest
      form, type II fun is when you feel in your heart like everything is going to
      implode (imposter syndrome, social rejection, pushing yourself to the limit),
      but you know in your head you are safe.<br><strong>Type III Fun</strong> is
      not fun, ever. It’s awful during the process and never redeeming after. Going
      to the DMV. Running through the twinge in your knee only to be in crutches for
      the next six months. Irreversible emotional damage from trauma. Avoid.<br><br>Type
      I fun is great. But to find a home at Tezza, you need to love type II fun. You
      want to push yourself or at least you want to want to push yourself. You may
      even enjoy some of the feelings (fear, intimidation) that you associate with
      these goals. To you, nothing is more satisfying than coming out the other side,
      saying, “Holy crap, we survived! I can’t believe it! What’s next?”

    headline: Are you a little weird?
    content: ''
  col_2:
    content: 'Normal people don’t like type II fun, and if you are a distinctly normal
      person, you probably aren’t going to like it here. We push boundaries: social,
      scientific, culinary, and more. Our moral compasses can create odd, occasionally
      fanatic behavior. We may have a drawer full of used plastic bags. We may bike
      to work even though it’s dumping rain. We may take trains for outrageously inconvenient
      distances. We relish breaking traditions or social norms to do the right thing
      or to do something well.<br><br>Our weirdness also comes across as a bit campy,
      less <em>Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>, more summer-campy/band-campy. We aren’t
      afraid to look like idiots, since we usually act like idiots because life is
      more fun that way. We are willing to ask awkward questions, share too much information,
      and build relationships quickly. We would rather play tag in the mud than wear
      suits in a conference room. We believe that a group of people with a goal and
      a safe space can change the world, and we can say that without rolling our eyes
      (that much).'

    headline: Do you consider money and power by-products?
    content: ''
  col_2:
    content: If money is your first priority, work in finance. If you want power above
      all, management consulting is a no-brainer. If you want to join a Silicon Valley
      startup with glossy offices, trendy swag, and fancy cars parked outside, there
      are many great options.<br><br>If you are here, be here because of the mission.
      Be here to work with other nerds excited about the same problems as you. Be
      here because you feel confident that everyone, bottom to top, wants to use dollars
      and power to fulfill the mission, not the pockets of nameless rich people. Unless
      things go to crap, everyone here will make plenty enough money, and we don’t
      abstain from things that bring us joy (savor every bite). But if you wear alligator
      leather shoes, Tezza is probably a bad fit.
