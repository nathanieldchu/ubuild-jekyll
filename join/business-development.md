  headline: About you
  content: "<p>You want to fight ecological destruction. You also want to be a part
    of the fast-paced, passion-driven world of startups. But you are looking for people
    who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private equity
    firms or shiny packaging for influencers.</p><p>For this position, you want to
    use your experience building teams and businesses to maintain an unwavering focus
    on sustainability as a global problem. Not a sort-your-trash kind of problem (although
    we do that anyway), but a scalable, mass-market, broad-social-change kind of problem.
    You always think about what it takes to grow, and you want to work with the team
    to make sure that optimistic ideals never get in the way of true impact.</p>"
