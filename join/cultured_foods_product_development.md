  headline: About you
  content: "<p>You want to fight ecological destruction. You also want to be a part
    of the fast-paced, passion-driven world of startups. But you are looking for people
    who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private equity
    firms or shiny packaging for influencers.</p><p>For this position, you prefer
    to get your hands dirty rather than stare at a computer screen. You love to tinker,
    make great food, work efficiently, maintain clear notes, and keep things orderly
    and clean.</p>"
