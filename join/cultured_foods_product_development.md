    content: You want to fight ecological destruction. You also want to be a part
      of the fast-paced, passion-driven world of startups. But you are looking for
      people who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private
      equity firms or shiny packaging for influencers.<br><br>For this position, you
      prefer to get your hands dirty rather than stare at a computer screen. You love
      to tinker, make great food, work efficiently, maintain clear notes, and keep
      things orderly and clean.

    content: Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table,
      the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. Our mission is to excite
      people about eating sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the
      diversity of the microbial world. We are starting with a new category of aged,
      hard cheeses—that happen to be made from plants. Founded by a nerd with fancy
      degrees from fancy places, we are taking the time to understand the science
      of cheesemaking and manipulating those processes to work with plants. We are
      a public benefit corporation, meaning that we are culturally and legally obligated
      to put our mission over money.

      experience doing research<br>2. Experience working in food production, food
      development, or consumer products<br>3. Experience building, making, or creating

      hours on occasional weekends to take care of certain types of cheeses (this
      responsibility is shared among the team)<br>2. Excited to do hands-on, detail
      oriented, manual and cerebral work

    content: We build relationships thoughtfully, and this approach takes time. Over
      multiple conversations, we will seek to understand how we can support you—and
      whether that support involves joining our team—and hopefully you will find out

      apply, please email join@tezzafoods.com with a resume and responses to the following
      prompts:<br>1. What motivates you right now? When you think about your short
      life, what motivates you for the long term? And most important, why?<br>2. Tell
      us a story about a time that you took a big risk. How did that decision and
      its aftermath shape who you are and how you navigate the world?<br>3. What is
      one idea in the sustainability movement that you think is clever? What is one
      that you think is dubious? Why?
