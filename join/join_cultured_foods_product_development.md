    headline: ''
    content: You want to fight ecological destruction. You also want to be a part
      of the fast-paced, passion-driven world of startups. But you are looking for
      people who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private
      equity firms or shiny packaging for influencers.<br><br>For this position, you
      prefer to get your hands dirty rather than stare at a computer screen. You love
      to tinker, make great food, work efficiently, maintain clear notes, and keep
      things orderly and clean.

    content: Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table,
      the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. Our mission is to excite
      people about eating sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the
      diversity of the microbial world. We are starting with a new category of aged,
      hard cheesesâ€”that happen to be made from plants. Founded by a nerd with fancy
      degrees from fancy places, we are taking the time to understand the science
      of cheesemaking and manipulating those processes to work with plants. We are
      a public benefit corporation, meaning that we are culturally and legally obligated
      to put our mission over money.
