  headline: About you
  content: "<p>You want to fight ecological destruction. You also want to be a part
    of the fast-paced, passion-driven world of startups. But you are looking for people
    who care about sustainability as more than window-dressing for private equity
    firms or shiny packaging for influencers.</p><p>For this position, you want to
    apply your microbiological curiosity to a real product that you can put in your
    mouth and out into the world. You want to be on the forefront of bringing modern
    community ecology and systems thinking to the still narrowly focused field of
    microbial engineering.</p>"

  headline: About us
  content: "<p>Our vision is a world where on every menu, grocery shelf, and table,
    the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable. Our mission is to excite
    people about eating sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity
    of the microbial world. We are starting with a new category of aged, hard cheesesâ€”that
    happen to be made from plants. Founded by a nerd with fancy degrees from fancy
    places, we are taking the time to understand the science of cheesemaking and manipulating
    those processes to work with plants. We are a public benefit corporation, meaning
    that we are culturally and legally obligated to put our mission over money.</p>"
