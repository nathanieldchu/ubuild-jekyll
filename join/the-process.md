  headline: The process
  content: <h4>Our hiring process involves 7 stages.</h4><p><strong>Initial application.
    </strong>When creating your resume, <a href="https://careers.google.com/videos/google-resume-tips-and-advice/"
    title="">google has pretty good advice</a> on how to build it. If you are a recent
    college/masters student, include your classes and grades. When responding to our
    questions, please be specific and elaborate. These answers are your chance to
    tell us about how we fit into the journey of your life. Do yourself justice.</p><p><strong>30
    minute in-person or video call conversation.</strong> We will have a brief, structured
    30 minute conversation with you to help give us context on who you are, how you
    think, and how you execute. What is special about you and how can we help you
    find the best place for your mind and heart? There will also be time for you to
    ask us questions.</p><p><strong>Practical skills assessment.</strong> For all
    positions, we will ask you to do a small project that will reflect the position.
    It's meant to be a chance to explore! These will usually take the shape of tasking
    you to ask a question, formulate a plan to seek answers, and execute that plan
    if practical. If you work in product development, we might ask you to document
    an experiment in the kitchen that you've been dying to do. Or if you are in a
    science role, we might ask you to do a limited literature review or analyze a
    recent paper of your choice.</p><p><strong>More 30 minute in-person or video call
    conversations</strong>. Depending on the role, you will have at least one more
    structured conversation with other team members.</p><p><strong>Extensive reference
    checks.</strong> Honestly, nobody is really good at reading people, so we try
    to incorporate the wisdom of the crowd. We will contact people who have interacted
    with you in different circumstances, including above, beside, and below you in
    a professional context and others from your personal network.</p><p><strong>Full-time
    trial period of 3 months.</strong> The real discovery begins! If we are both excited
    about a potential fit, you will be hired as a full-time consultant for three-months.
    During this time, we'll seek answers to whether the job and our team is the right
    fit for this stage of your journey. We will make a learning plan with you to ensure
    that you grow during the experience. At multiple time points, you will meet with
    the team and exchange feedback. If at any time you or the team decide that the
    fit is not right, you will be supported financially, professionally, and emotionally
    for the remainder of the period as we try to find a better place for you.</p><p><strong>You
    join the colony or we help you find your next adventure.</strong> Whatever the
    outcome, we want to enable you to achieve your mission. If you join us, we will
    challenge each other everyday to make ourselves and the world better. If you don't,
    we will do the same thing but probably a lot less frequently.</p>
