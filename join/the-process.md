  headline: The process
  content: <p><strong>Initial application. </strong>When creating your resume, <a
    href="https://careers.google.com/videos/google-resume-tips-and-advice/" title="">google
    has pretty good advice</a> on how to build it. If you are a recent college/masters
    student, include your classes and grades. When responding to our written questions,
    please be specific and elaborate. These answers are your chance to tell us about
    how we fit into the journey of your life. Do yourself justice.</p><p><strong>30
    minute in-person or video call conversation.</strong> We will have a brief, structured
    30 minute conversation with you to help give us context on who you are, how you
    think, and how you execute. What is special about you and how can we help you
    find the best place for your mind and heart? There will also be time for you to
    ask us questions.</p><p><strong>Practical skills assessment.</strong> For all
    positions, we will ask you to do a small project that reflects the position. It's
    meant to be a chance to explore! These projects will usually take the shape of
    tasking you to ask a question, formulate a plan to seek answers, and execute that
    plan if practical. If the job is in product development, we may ask you to document
    an experiment in the kitchen that you've been dying to do. Or if it is a science
    role, we may ask you to do a small literature review or analyze a recent paper
    of your choice.</p><p><strong>More 30 minute in-person or video call conversations</strong>.
    Depending on the role, you will have at least one more structured conversation
    with other team members.</p><p><strong>Extensive reference checks.</strong> Honestly,
    nobody is really good at reading people, so we try to incorporate the wisdom of
    the crowd. We will contact people who have interacted with you in different circumstances,
    including above, beside, and below you in a professional context and others from
    your personal network.</p><p><strong>Full-time trial period of 3 months.</strong>
    The real discovery begins! If we are both excited about a potential fit, you will
    be hired as a full-time consultant for three-months. During this time, we'll seek
    answers to whether the job and our team is the right fit for this stage of your
    journey. We will make a learning plan with you to ensure that you grow during
    the experience. At multiple time points, you will meet with the team and exchange
    feedback. If at any time you or the team decide that the fit is not right, you
    will be supported financially, professionally, and emotionally for the remainder
    of the period as you find a better place.</p><p><strong>You join the colony or
    we help you find your next adventure.</strong> Whatever the outcome, we want to
    enable you to achieve your mission. If you join us, we will challenge each other
    everyday to make ourselves and the world better. If you don't, we will do the
    same thing but probably a lot less frequently. At minimum, there will probably
    be a chance to have an awkward moment where you don't know if a hug or handshake
    is more appropriate. Isn't life great?</p>
