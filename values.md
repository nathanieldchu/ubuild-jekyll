    content: "<strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how
      you do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and
      everything else that brought you here in the first place.<br><br><strong>Empower
      others</strong>. Seek your success by helping others achieve theirs. On your
      death-bed, what will you remember: learning to ride a bike or teaching your
      kid to ride a bike? By helping others, you achieve missions greater than yourself
      and feel the joy of being proud instead of pompous.<br><br><strong>Strive for
      better</strong>. To make a future world better than the present, make your present
      self better than your past. Challenge yourself to change. Invest in the person
      you want remembered. Donâ€™t compare yourself to others, but to who you were yesterday.<br><br><strong>Treat
      feedback as a gift</strong>. Ideas, critiques, questions, and feelings are the
      most valuable things you will ever give or get. Give them thoughtfully, and
      receive them gratefully.<br><br><strong>Savor every bite</strong>. Have fun
      and take care of yourself. You have one life; bask in it."
