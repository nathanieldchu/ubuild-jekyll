  headline: Nathaniel D. Chu
  content: I fell in love with the natural world during a childhood spent collecting
    bugs and searching for salamanders. This love led me to study how the ecology
    of microbes generate or prevent disease in the context of coral reefs—as a Fulbright
    Fellow with the Smithsonian Institute—and in the context of the bacteria that
    live in the human gut—as a PhD at MIT. I also taught team-building, communication,
    and facilitation as an expedition leader with YMCA Camp Orkila. I am combining
    these passions with my joy of eating to find ways to create foods with big flavors
    and tiny footprints.
