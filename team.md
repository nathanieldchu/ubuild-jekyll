  headline: Nathaniel D. Chu
  content: I studied genetics and evolution as a undergraduate at Brown University
    (2012) then coral reef diseases as a Fulbright Fellow with the Smithsonian Institution
    in Panama. As a PhD student at MIT, I studied the gut microbiome—the bacteria
    that live on and in the human body—and how it generates disease and contributes
    to human health and nutrition. As an sea-kayaking expedition leader with YMCA
    Camp Orkila, I taught communication and leadership to teens with YMCA Camp Orkila.<br><br>Now,
    I am thrilled to combine these passions to find ways to make the most delicious
    choice also the most sustainable choice.
