  headline: Nathaniel D. Chu
  content: 'When I was a kid in the Pacific Northwest, my mother and her marine biologist
    friends insisted that I learn how to pronounce two names: <em>Strongylocentrotus
    purpuratus</em> (the scientific term for purple sea urchins) and <em>parmigiano
    reggiano</em> (the king of cheeses). This insistence led to two inescapable things:
    (1) I would always love nature and food, and (2) I would probably be a nerd.<br><br>After
    a youth fighting the latter destiny, I studied evolution at Brown University,
    then coral reef diseases as a Fulbright Fellow with the Smithsonian Institution
    in Panama. As a PhD student at MIT, I studied the gut microbiome—bacteria that
    live in the human body—and how it generates disease and contributes to human health.
    In between, I led sea-kayaking expeditions in the San Juan Islands, teaching communication
    and leadership to teens.<br><br>Now, I am building Tezza as an excuse to eat my
    way to saving the wild places I love.'
