  headline: Nathaniel D. Chu
  content: 'As a kid, I fell in love with the natural world searching for salamanders
    in roadside ditches and learned to cook with the help of Kraft mac and cheese.
    As a student, I studied genetics at Brown University, coral reef diseases as a
    Fulbright Fellow with the Smithsonian Institution in Panama, and the gut microbiome—the
    bacteria that live on and in the human body—during a PhD at MIT. As an sea-kayaking
    expedition leader, I taught communication and leadership to teens with YMCA Camp
    Orkila.<br><br>Now, I am combining these passions to find ways to make the most
    delicious choice also the most sustainable choice. I get stoked on efficiency,
    being outside, climbing and mountaineering, and pretending I''m a bear while sitting
    in blueberry bushes.<br><br>Fun sustainability fact: I was once called a "cheeky
    wanker" for picking up a British tourist''s discarded banana peels. I felt like
    I had be knighted.'
