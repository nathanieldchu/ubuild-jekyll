  headline: Nathaniel D. Chu
  content: I studied genetics and evolution as an undergraduate at Brown University,
    then coral reef diseases as a Fulbright Fellow with the Smithsonian Institution
    in Panama. As a PhD student at MIT, I studied the gut microbiome—the bacteria
    that live on and in the human body—and how it generates disease and contributes
    to human health. As a sea-kayaking expedition leader with YMCA Camp Orkila, I
    taught communication and leadership to teens.<br><br>Now I am thrilled to combine
    these passions to find ways to make the most delicious choice also the most sustainable
    choice.
