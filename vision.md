# Who we are

Our vision is on every menu, aisle, and table, the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable

To achieve that vision, we get people excited to eat sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the microbial world.

And it all starts with hard, aged cheeses made from sustainable plants.
