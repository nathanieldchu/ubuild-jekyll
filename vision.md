  content: "<strong>Give a shit</strong>. Care about what you do, care about how you
    do it, care about the people you do it with, and care about the planet and everything
    else that brought you here in the first place.<br><br><strong>Empower others</strong>.
    Seek your success by helping others achieve theirs. On your death-bed, what will
    you remember: learning to ride a bike or teaching your kid to ride a bike? By
    helping others, you achieve missions greater than yourself and feel the joy of
    being proud instead of pompous.<br><br><strong>Strive for better</strong>. To
    make a future world better than the present, make your present self better than
    your past. Challenge yourself to change. Invest in the person you want remembered.
    Donâ€™t compare yourself to others, but to who you were yesterday.<br><br><strong>Treat
    feedback as a gift</strong>. Ideas, critiques, questions, and feelings are the
    most valuable things you will ever give or get. Give them thoughtfully, and receive
    them gratefully.<br><br><strong>Savor every bite</strong>. Have fun and take care
    of yourself. You have one life; bask in it."

# Who we are

Our vision is on every menu, aisle, and table, the most exciting foods are also the most sustainable

To achieve that vision, we get people excited to eat sustainably by crafting cultured foods that tap into the diversity of the microbial world.

And it all starts with hard, aged cheeses made from sustainable plants.
