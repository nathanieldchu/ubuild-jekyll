        <h2><span class="light">Nathaniel D. Chu</span></h2>
        <p>As a kid, I fell in love with the natural world searching for salamanders in roadside ditches and learned to cook with the help of Kraft mac and cheese. As a student, I studied genetics at Brown University, coral reef diseases as a Fulbright Fellow with the Smithsonian Institution in Panama, and the gut microbiome—the bacteria that live on and in the human body—during a PhD at MIT. As an sea-kayaking expedition leader, I taught communication and leadership to teens with YMCA Camp Orkila.<br><br>Now, I am combining these passions to find ways to make the most delicious choice also the most sustainable choice. I get stoked on efficiency, being outside, climbing and mountaineering, and pretending I'm a bear while sitting in blueberry bushes.<br><br>Fun sustainability fact: I was once called a "cheeky wanker" for picking up a British tourist's discarded banana peels. I felt like I had be knighted.</p>
