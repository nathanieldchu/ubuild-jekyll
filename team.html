        <p>I studied genetics and evolution as an undergraduate at Brown University, then coral reef diseases as a Fulbright Fellow with the Smithsonian Institution in Panama. As a PhD student at MIT, I studied the gut microbiome—the bacteria that live on and in the human body—and how it generates disease and contributes to human health. As a sea-kayaking expedition leader with YMCA Camp Orkila, I taught communication and leadership to teens.<br><br>Now I am thrilled to combine these passions to find ways to make the most delicious choice also the most sustainable choice.</p>
